# Pakistan-Weather-App
I have created a Pakistan Weather GUI Interface with Tkinter. This project is made for the mandatory final project of Stanford: Code in Place course. In this project, tkinter, and tkintermapview library is used, and the weather API by city name is called to do the functionality of the GUI interface.
